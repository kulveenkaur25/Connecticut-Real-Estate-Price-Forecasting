# 🏠 Connecticut Real Estate Price Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting real estate sale prices across the state of Connecticut using over two decades of property transaction data (2001–2022). It uses machine learning models and time-series forecasting techniques to provide actionable insights for investors, realtors, and policy makers.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Predict individual property sale prices using features such as assessed value, property type, and sale date.
- Forecast statewide median sale prices for the next 24 months.
- Understand the impact of location, time, and property characteristics on sale price.
- Visualize seasonal trends, anomalies, and market shifts.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, PySpark, Pandas, NumPy
- **ML Models:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees
- **Forecasting:** Facebook Prophet, SARIMA
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform:** Google Colab

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Random Forest achieved an **R² of ~0.92** and low RMSE on log-transformed prices.
- Prophet revealed rising median sale prices with clear seasonal trends.
- SARIMA effectively modeled short-term fluctuations in commercial sales volume.
- Regional models (North Connecticut) captured sharper local price variations.

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- Managing a dataset of over 1.2 million records (solved using PySpark).
- Handling inconsistent or missing date fields.
- Dealing with outliers from extremely high-value sales.
